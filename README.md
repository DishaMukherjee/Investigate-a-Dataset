## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- CSV

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! 

## Project Overview <a name="project_overview"></a>
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## Project Outcome <a name="outcome"></a>
After completing the project, I have learned following :

* Know what all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can used
* Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with Pandas Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Last but not least know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing findings.
